REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Summary

> This is a tic - tac - toe game. Its written by me Tobias for the programming course at komvux in SkÃ¶vde. 
> This was my first "big" project when it comes to programming. Its been very fun and educating to do a own programm and reseaching diffrent 
> things that could make way for this project. I have sometimes felt like I wanted to rip out my hair in frustration because somethings wouldnt work
> but I never gave up and that a huge part of programming I think. Just because something doesnt work doesnt mean you should give up. I used whiteboards on the
> computer to draw things, I have been speaking to myself and friends about problems just to hear myself saying the problem and that have helped me with this project.
> I choose to do a tic - tac - toe game because I felt that this would be difficult in just not coding but also logically.
> Getting the right code in the right place at the right time is crucial and key for a game like this to work.
> I have also tried to only include stuff that we learnt on the course so that maybe new programmers can
> look at this project and follow along with how I did and didnt do things. I belive that there is always things that could improve but that also comes with an
> improvement of knowleadge. I might revisit this project sometime in the future and update things as I learn new things or I might just leave it be as a piece of
> my programming history for something to look back at and see how it looked like when I just started programming. 
> The requirement for this project was to use 30 hours. I was done at the 30 hours mark but there was still some weeks left until presentation and submisson day. 
> I added and reworked some ideas and things that me and Colin talked about during class and meetings. For example I changed the algorithm 
> for checking the playingboard for a winner. This proved to be more diffucult than I thought but in the end 
> I made something that worked out just not for my playingbord but also for something that would work on a bigger playingboard.
> So I might use that for future projects. Total time spent on this project is around 36 hours. Alot of them is just thinking and 
> drawing on a whiteboard and testing diffrent code. I spent some hours learning CSS aswell. This is a programm and a project that has many solutions. 
> In the beginning I thought that this would be a walk in the park but as problems and errors started to occur then 
> I had to start solve them aswell as going forward with the project. I like problemsolving and this is just the project for someone that like that. Im really
> happy that I did this and spent the hours because I have learnt alot. Thank you Colin! 
>
> List of things that can be improved:
> 1: The algorithm that checks the playingboard for a winner. The winning condition algorithm could be less repetetiv or atleast I think it could be.
> 2: The CSS and layout of the page could be more appealing to the players.
> 3: An AI player that would play vs a human player when there is only 1 player.
>
> Conclusion on the budget:
> I spent around 36 hours doing this project. The first hours I spent was on CSS and making a 3 by 3 grid/playingboard. I spent some hours drawing on a whiteboard
> just so I could visulize the problems and errors that I ran in to. console.log is your best friend! When I reached the 30 hour mark that I had a working programm
> but that it could be imporved. I got some help from Colin and redid some of the code to be less repetitive. I added some algorithm that could check the 
> playingboard even if it was bigger then my 3 by 3 grid. I redid my function that checks for a winner, before it was hardcoded for each winning condition. I redid
> the function that I use for the squares, before I used a function for each and every square. I added the possibility to use continue with the same players and 
> have a scoreboard so that the players could keep the score and keep battling eachother. You could say that at one point in the project I got in to a chokepoint 
> and didnt really knew how to go forward but then it just struck me and then the project went forward with great speed. I would say that I was done at hour 30 and 
> things added after that is improvements and better code knowledge. 

# User Guide

> How to use my tic - tac - toe programm:
> 1: Load the programm!
> 2: Choose a username for you and your duelist!
> 3: Battle it out in an epic game of tic - tac - toe! 
> 4: There is a lightmode and a darkmode so your eyes wont be hurting after hours and hours playing tic - tac - toe.
