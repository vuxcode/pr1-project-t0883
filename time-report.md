  Been reading on how to tackle this project. Watch and read some css and thinking about include it later in the project.
  Started to use Sublime merge since I prefer to code in Sublime instead of VisualStudioCode.
  Spent 1 hour on reading on how to make a 2D playing field and geting it to work in console. 
  Also made a button that deletes the first array and replaces it with an X. This is not what I want or what is intended.
  Also drank some coffee and watch John Hammond doing the picoCTF challenge.

  Been awhile since I updated the program. I have been working on the program on the side and testing some diffrent thing and didnt want to 
  clutter the index.html file that I use to submit things to github. Did things in another .html file that I used as a "kladdpapper"
  and now I feel like I have something so submit and show. There is still things to do such as adding the 0 player, getting the buttons to
  display X and O and much more. I have for now invested about 10 hours in this project with most of it have been used to read up on 
  CSS styling. Sorry for not updating the project but I will be more frequent for now and on until final submission.

  Added some functions that I wanna use. Want to make them work and then in a late stage combine them in 1 function. For now the 
  program just places Xs. For now I have invested 11 hours in the program including research and learning new things.

  Re did the hole script. I think I have been thinking a bit wrong and I finally we able to get things right. Now the functions do just like I 
  want to and they update the arrays as expected. 
  I have spent about 4 hours now adding CSS and making functions that makes sense. 
  Total spent time on project is now 15 hours and im about to pass the halfway mark for this project.
  Put in some hours today and the total time is now 17 hours. Working on geting a win/tie message and also for a function that can check for a winner while the
  game is running.

  Its friday so I decided to spice things up and add a button that changes the background to a softer color for the eyes.
  Also started thinking about the winning message function and how I should check rows and cols. Had a great "review" session
  with Colin and it feels like im on the right path.
  Total time spent is now 19 hours. Time flies when you have fun!

  Today I made huge progress on the project! Now you get a winning message and a tie message, the players also are able to choose a player name. 
  If a player name is not choosen then the player get the standard x or o name and mark on the playingboard. I only need to fix the tie message
  and when its fix I could say that the project is done. Its alot of lines of code and alot of the code is hardcorded to a value 
  just so the program cant be broken down. Im very happy with the outcome of this project and I think this is the way to make a 
  tic-tac-toe in javascript. It has the option to be customized by the user and the cant be broken by weird or invalid inputs from the 
  users. Total time is now 25 hours.
