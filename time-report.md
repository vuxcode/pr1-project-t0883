  Been reading on how to tackle this project. Watch and read some css and thinking about include it later in the project.
  Started to use Sublime merge since I prefer to code in Sublime instead of VisualStudioCode.
  Spent 1 hour on reading on how to make a 2D playing field and geting it to work in console. 
  Also made a button that deletes the first array and replaces it with an X. This is not what I want or what is intended.
  Also drank some coffee and watch John Hammond doing the picoCTF challenge.
