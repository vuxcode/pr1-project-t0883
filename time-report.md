  Been reading on how to tackle this project. Watch and read some css and thinking about include it later in the project.
  Started to use Sublime merge since I prefer to code in Sublime instead of VisualStudioCode.
  Spent 1 hour on reading on how to make a 2D playing field and geting it to work in console. 
  Also made a button that deletes the first array and replaces it with an X. This is not what I want or what is intended.
  Also drank some coffee and watch John Hammond doing the picoCTF challenge.

  Been awhile since I updated the program. I have been working on the program on the side and testing some diffrent thing and didnt want to 
  clutter the index.html file that I use to submit things to github. Did things in another .html file that I used as a "kladdpapper"
  and now I feel like I have something so submit and show. There is still things to do such as adding the 0 player, getting the buttons to
  display X and O and much more. I have for now invested about 10 hours in this project with most of it have been used to read up on 
  CSS styling. Sorry for not updating the project but I will be more frequent for now and on until final submission.
